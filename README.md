# esp8266-basic-wifi / letsencrypt

This branch covers making HTTPS requests on ESP8266, using a small set of trusted root certificates (Let's Encrypt's roots) for TLS verification. See my blog post for more: [HTTPS Requests with a Small Set of Root Certificates on ESP8266 + Arduino *(October 29, 2021)*](https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2021/10/HTTPS-Requests-with-a-Small-Set-of-Root-Certificates-on-ESP8266-Arduino.html).
